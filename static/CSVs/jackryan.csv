Jack Ryan             TV Series (2018– ),sjamess,8.1,"Season 1 was great. It was suspensful, well-acted, briskly paced, and reasonably sophisticated as far as real world politics are concerned. The writers for Season 2 apparently scored a Groupon on lobotomies, as they demonstrate the intelligence of a developementally delayed baboon. I mean everything is just so dumb. Characters do things simply to advance the plot without any explanation or motivation. Noomi Rapace's character just magically materializes whenever the plot needs it. The General Ubarri character is totally wasted. Worst of all, the writers managed to turn Jack Ryan into an uncharismatic idiot. The only reason he manages to solve the conspiracy is because Noomi's character inexplicably does him a favor off screen. Awful, just awful. I give it 4 stars because the footage shot in Colombia looks nice."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 17 January 2014 (India),thefilmguy7,6.2,"It's ironic that ""Jack Ryan"" is part of the title for this one because this is the furthest from the character that any of the films have been. Beyond a some what similar back-story, the doctor soon to be wife, and that he works for the CIA, Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him more into a spy/field agent than the brainy analyst that he's meant to be. As a result, there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest of it's genre. It's just another spy movie with an over the top villain that's plotting world domination. It's predictable and generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. "
