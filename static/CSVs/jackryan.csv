Jack Ryan             TV Series (2018– ),pattykiker,8.1,"First, I was a fan of the original Tom Clancy Jack Ryan but I'm open to updating and reimagining and thought season 1 was tight with great writing, an original story line of the making of a terrorist, and excellent characterization and action. What the heck happened to season 2? It's like the writer room watched ""A Clear and Present Danger"" and ""Moon Over Parador"" and decided to do a mash up. The action is the only saving grace. I won't be a spoiler but knew who the real bad guy was in the second episode from the clumsy ""foreshadowing"" dialog. I hope they get some new writers for the third season. John Krasinski looks baffled in most of the episodes so I'm guessing he's with me on this one."
Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 17 January 2014 (India),polygnotus,6.2,"What an utterly sad and offensive legacy for Tom Clancy. In Hollywood, truly, nothing is sacred."
