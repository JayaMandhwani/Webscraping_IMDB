House of Cards             TV Series (2013–2018),geekster-6,8.7,"When I thought about Francis Urquhart of the original House of Cards series, I could not help but imagine Kevin Spacey in a way that was similar but a role of his own making. Spacey's role of Francis Underwood, in Netflix's original series, is nothing short of a tour de force. The convenience of being able to watch the whole season right away is also something to mention as a new, fresh and exciting method of television excellence. No longer do we have to wait and be fed slowly the episodes as we wonder what might happen and find ourselves somewhat disappointed -- now we can be swept away. And that's exactly what will happen to you when you sit down to watch this. 13/10."
House of Cards             TV Mini-Series (1990),RPK1619,8.5,"I found the series at Best Buy (House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut) all packaged together.  I was really excited, because I think this is one of the best to come from the BBC.  Ian Richardson was superb. Wicked and cunning.  I watched the first installment the other night and was glued to my chair for 4 hours.  I highly recommend this series."
House of Cards 25 June 1993 (USA),saffrin,6.3,"This film was educational about the problems that autistic children face. The part of the film that stays with me is when Tommy Lee Jones's character states that a lot of autistic children are misdiagnosed as crack babies or something else....even demonic possession.  I work with autistic children and the repetition shown by the children in the movie is displayed.  If you want to see a healthy environment for autustic children, this movie has it."
The Final Cut             TV Mini-Series (1995),timdalton007,8.1,"Having risen through the ranks of the United Kingdom's Conservative Party in House Of Cards and having consolidated power in To Play The King, Francis Urquhart (played once again by Ian Richardson) is on the verge of becoming the longest serving Prime Minister. Yet the pieces are slowly moving against him for last game of power politics. The stage is set for The Final Cut, the final miniseries in the House Of Cards trilogy."
